Description: "Protobuf: The Google protobuf compiler and runtimes for various languages"

Local Modifications: Initial changes include support for the micro
protobuf compiler and the assoicated runtime.

Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient
yet extensible format. Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all
of its internal RPC protocols and file formats.

Initially the protoc compiler is not integrated into the Android build system
and the Android.mk will simply build the javamicro runtime static library.

To build the compiler follow the instructions in README.txt for
compiling and installing.

The Android.mk file creates the a static library which can be added
to any Android application by Adding to LOCAL_STATIC_JAVA_LIBRARIES
com.google.protobuf.micro:

  LOCAL_STATIC_JAVA_LIBRARIES += com.google.protobuf.micro

Follow the instructions in Micro section of java/README.txt for
details on compiling .proto files for the micro runtine.
